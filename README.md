# Private-events
Private-events is a miniture project for Rails practice. It is my first project that has a many-to-many model relationship
between the users and the events.

This project is part of [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails track.
The project itself can be seen [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/associations?ref=lc-pb)!
